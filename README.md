## 🛠️ Usage

### ▶️ Starting the Workspace

```bash
python launch.py
```
After launching you get the tokenID for session which you can use to login. You can easily find it above the log section.

### 🌐 Accessing Services

* **Jupyter Lab** → [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
* **TensorBoard** → [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

### ⚙️ Managing the Environment

```bash
# Stop workspace
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Enter container shell
docker-compose exec ml-workspace bash

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

## 🔧 Customization

### ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (optional):

```bash
# User configuration
ML_USER=your_username
ML_UID=1000

# Git configuration (optional)
GIT_USER_NAME="Your Name"
GIT_USER_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"
```

### ➕ Adding Packages

Add dependencies in `environment.yml`, then rebuild:

```bash
docker-compose down
python launch.py
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Common Issues

**Port already in use**

```bash
lsof -i :8888
lsof -i :6006
# Or edit ports in docker-compose.yml
```

**Docker permission issues**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

**Build failures**

```bash
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a
python launch.py
```

**Out of disk space**

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

### 🩺 Getting Help

* Check logs: `docker-compose logs ml-workspace`
* Ensure Docker Desktop is running
* Verify free space (20GB+ recommended)
* See `INSTALL.md` for platform-specific instructions
